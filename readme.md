A script to use in conjunction with Audacity that automatically imports and mixes given audio files in m4a or mp3 format. An update to the first rudimentary quick proof-of-concept:

Which I had never expected to use so much that I would make it more of a personal passion project and utility for my own creative endeavors in audio mixing as a personal hobby. I now designed and fully intend to leverage my skills in a revamped full-featured program more sophisticated (and structured) than the original.
