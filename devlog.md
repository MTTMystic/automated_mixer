Switch dev environment to ubuntu vm and sublime text. Organization of new design necessitated deleting first attempt at structuring project in favor of OOP and starting with implementation priorities (i.e. defining test casses for class structure of mixer).

Starting point is skeleton of automated mixer main class -- sure to evolve, but basic entry point. Outlined basic steps for initializing the automixer as a blueprint for dev stages. Using branch am_class_structure and subbranch to tackle error reporting (top priority).

Otlined error reporting tests, error class (handler) structure and success/fail, and dev_mode reporting. Designing before bed is fun even if I save the code for another day :)

Decied to pt error handling on backburner as qol feature and focus on main functionality first
